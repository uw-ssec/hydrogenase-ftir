#flip element order function: input array and name for the inverted array
def flip_order(x):
    """
    Reverse the order of elements in the given array.
    This function takes an array and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

    Parameters:
    - x (array-like): The input array whose elements are to be reversed. The input should be
      be any array-like structure.
    Returns:
    - array-like: A new array containing the elements of the input array in reverse order.
      The type of the returned array is the same as the input array.

    Note:
    - The function does not modify the original array; it returns a new array with the
      elements reversed.

    Computes the second derivative of a specific range of absorbance data from spectroscopic analysis which has water vapor subtracted from it  

    Parameters:
        cut_sub_data (Tuple[List[AtmFitParams], np.ndarray]): A tuple where the first element is a list of AtmFitParams
            objects, and the second element is an ndarray. The AtmFitParams objects must have 'wavenb' (wavenumbers) 
            'spectrum' (from which atmospheric contributions will be subtracted ), and atm_spectra (array of atmosphere spectra).

    Notes:
    The function extracts the wavenumbers and corresponding absorbance values, calculates their second derivative using
    numpy's gradient function, and then inverts the data to create a spline representation. It optionally plots the second derivative data for visual inspection.
